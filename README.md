# MC3-SweetUI
ADA MC3


## Description

* SweetUI is an Ipad OS and Mac OS Catalyst app which targets Apple SwiftUI Developers
* The idea is to create a database of SwiftUI Views developers can share together -> Tap a view, get the code
* This app was first realized as a project in team at Apple Developer Academy Naples 2022

## How it works

* User is authenticated via iCloud which is mandatory to be able to upload a View
* Database is stored in Cloudkit
* Click + button at the top right corner to upload your own view: upload a screenshot from your photo library and paste the code
* Any user authenticated or not can browse the database of views, tap one, and copy the code
